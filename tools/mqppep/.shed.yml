long_description: |
  Phosphoproteomic Enrichment Pipeline provides tools two tools for processing MaxQuant data for phosphoproteome-enriched samples.
 
  "MaxQuant Phosphopeptide Preprocessing" (mqppep_preproc) transforms the 'Phospho (STY)Sites.txt' output file that MaxQuant produces for for phosphoproteome-enriched samples to prepare it for ANOVA.

  "MaxQuant Phosphopeptide ANOVA" (mqppep_anova) performs ANOVA on the preprocessed data.
